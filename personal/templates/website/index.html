    <h2>Neuronal development</h2>
    <p class="rblurb">
      How the brain is organized remains a central question in biology.
      Sensory axons are known to form ordered con&shy;nec&shy;tions in the
      brain in which the neighbor relationship between cells is preserved.
      This topographic mapping is thought to be essential for the efficient
      transfer of in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion.
      In my current research, I have identified a mol&shy;e&shy;cule required
      for maintaining topographic order in the mam&shy;ma&shy;li&shy;an visual
      system.

    <h2>Structure prediction</h2>
    <p class="rblurb">
      Interactions between complex carbohydrates other 
      mac&shy;ro&shy;mol&shy;e&shy;cules are
      critical in several neurological processes and disease states.
      Unfortunately, het&shy;er&shy;o&shy;ge&shy;ne&shy;i&shy;ty and 
      oth&shy;er factors make these carbohydrates difficult to study, and our
      understanding of these interactions is often
      limited.
      To address this, I am developing methods to model these interactions
      computationally.
